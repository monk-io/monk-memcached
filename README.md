    memcached-cache-size: 128
    memcached-max-connections: 2000
    memcached-threads: 4
    memcached-max-item-size: 8388608
    memcached-username: "my_user"
    memcached-password: "my_password"
    memcached-extra-flags: ""
```

## Local Deployment

| First clone the repository simply run below command after launching `monkd`: |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

```bash
âžœ  monk load MANIFEST
âœ” Read files successfully
âœ” Loaded memcached.yaml successfully

Loaded 2 runnables, 0 process groups, 0 services, 0 entities and 0 entity instances
âœ¨ Loaded:
 â””â”€ðŸ”© Runnables:
    â”œâ”€ðŸ§© memcached/memcached
    â””â”€ðŸ§© memcached/base
âœ” All templates loaded successfully

âžœ  monk list -l memcached
âœ” Got the list
Type      Template             Repository  Version  Tags

runnable  memcached/memcached  local       -        Memcached, Distributed Caching, In-Memory Cache, High-Performance, Scalability, Key-Value Store, Open Source, Data Retrieval, Web Caching, Cache Management, Server-Side Caching, API Caching, Cloud Computing, Microservices, NoSQL

âžœ  monk run  memcached/memcached

âœ” Started local/memcached/memcached

```

This will start the entire memcached/stack.

## Cloud Deployment

To deploy the above system to your cloud provider, create a new Monk cluster and provision your instances.

```bash
âžœ  monk cluster new
? New cluster name memcached
âœ” Cluster created
Your cluster has been created successfully.

âžœ  monk cluster provider add -p gcp -f <path/to/your-key.json>
âœ” Provider added successfully

âžœ  monk cluster grow -p gcp
? Cloud provider gcp
? Name of the new instance memcached-instance
? Tags (split by whitespace) memcached
? Region europe-central2
? Zone europe-central2-a
? Instance type e2-medium
? Number of instances (or press ENTER to use default = 1) 3
? Default disk type for gcp is HDD (pd-standard). Would you like to change it? No
? Disk size (or press ENTER to use default = 250 GBs) 50
âœ” Start creation of new instance(s) on gcp... DONE
âœ” Creating node: my-instance-1 DONE
âœ” Initializing node: my-instance-1 DONE
âœ” Creating node: my-instance-2 DONE
âœ” Initializing node: my-instance-2 DONE
âœ” Creating node: my-instance-3 DONE
âœ” Initializing node: my-instance-3 DONE

âœ” Connecting: my-instance-3 DONE
âœ” Syncing peer: my-instance-2 DONE
âœ” Syncing peer: my-instance-3 DONE
âœ” Syncing nodes DONE
âœ” Cluster grown successfully
```

## Logs & Shell

```bash
# show Memcached logs
âžœ  monk logs -l 1000 -f memcached/memcached

# access shell in the container running Memcached
âžœ  monk shell memcached/memcached

```

## Stop, remove and clean up workloads and templates

```bash
âžœ monk purge -x  memcached/memcached

âœ” memcached/memcached purged
```
